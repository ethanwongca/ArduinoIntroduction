# Arduino Introduction Projects
Here is some Introduction Code on Some Arduino Projects that I have done.

<h2> Libraries and Languages </h2>
Arduino C++ but simplified 

<h2> Project Examples </h2>

Some projects include getting motors to work with remotes, using servos, buzzers, etc. 

These are just some quick projects I did in my free time as I wanted to make a simple mechanical project.
